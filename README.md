# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I get a lot of questions by email. I guess, this is the most meaningful way to make answers globally present!

Anything doesn't mean *anything*. Only relevant to my topics.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
